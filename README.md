# catfactory

This is a DOM manipulation demonstration. On this page, you can create cats with the click of a button by using array methods, and each of them will go into motion and bounce around the browser window at its own pace. As you click the Dance Party button, they will speed up!

# How to Run

Click +1 Cat to add as many cats as you would like! Click the Dance Party button to see them bounce all over your browser.

# Roadmap of future improvements

* Add random colors to play during movement
* Stop cats from spawning on buttons
* Add dance music to play during movement
